# Charmed-hadrons-topology
This repository represents the analysis of the decay topology of the charmed hadrons resulting from  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O_t=\text { Onset event at time bin } t " /> .
This serves as a cross-check for the efficiency of the detectors before doing the analysis on the tau particle because the charmed hadrons have a similar decay behavior of the tau particle.
