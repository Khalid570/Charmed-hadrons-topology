# Charmed-hadrons-topology
This repository represents the analysis of the decay topology of the charmed hadrons resulting from <img src= "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\nu{\mu} \text{interaction}" />.
This serves as a cross-check for the efficiency of the detectors before doing the analysis on the tau particle because the charmed hadrons have a similar decay behavior of the tau particle.
